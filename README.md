# S3T6TM2
# Initial Ideas

 * Possible new functions:
 * Manager vs. Developer functions based on login
 * GUI
 * Pausing tasks
 * Possible data structures: serializing, not having a set space for data, dynamic. 
 * Adding notes/comments to tasks
 * Notifications for due dates or budget limit approaching
 * Possibly dropping sizes
 * Cool-looking summaries (downloadable spreadsheet?):

Timely


Look into Timely app. What I like is that it combines a report and adding tasks into one screen really. On the left you can see, that you can still get a more detailed report. If we were to do something like this we can put basic information onto a screen that has some of the information you would get in a report, like time spent on a project, budget (on that in a bit). And then a report tab would provide a more detailed report on each task, as sizes, times, description, etc. (see below).


As for budget: I mentioned today about due dates. How about we implement that through budget. Time can be your budget. Suppose you have 40 working hours in a week, and you are given 30 to complete a task. You log 15 hours, and it would show you have 50% of your budget left. 
With any feature we try to add we need to think about whether or not it is reasonably doable for us in the time we have, so letâ€™s not go crazy with new features.
