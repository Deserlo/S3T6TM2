# Design Document for TM 

## Introduction

Our Time Management application "TM" is created mainly for developers and managers of small teams to help them track time more efficiently to increase productivity. Clients in a commercial setting will find that actively managing time to reduce the amount of wasted resources will increase revenue for that company; however, this product is not just for commercial uses. Clients in a non-commercial setting will still find this application useful: it will help anyone and their team stay focused on whatever project they are working on.

## Product Reviews

We have looked into two applications for research purposes: Timely and GetHarvest. 
The **Timely** application is a simple application that helps track time, profit, and efficiency. It is easy to use and implements a modern user unterface. Timely is built with obsession with time in mind and promises users to find the "25th hour", meaning that it would deliver increased time efficiency to the user. A very neat feature Timely offers is a stopwatch that a user can click to start logging time, it doesn't get more user-friendly than that. Timely also have implemented an idea of time as budget for each project, which gave us the idea of adding budget to TM.
**GetHarvest** started out with a simple focus on time tracking in 2006, Harvest has grown considerably over the last decade and now encompasses invoicing and project management. Even after expanding into the invoicing world, the software is still focused on time and team management and has over 50,000 users. It is easy to use and provides deeper integration than Timely. Some of the features also include downloadable Summary spreadheets and future project time estimation.

**Ideas of ours influenced by Timely:**
* Beautiful Spreadsheets
* A budget variable instead of size
* Organizing tasks through multiple projects

**Ideas of ours influenced by GetHarvest:**
* Easy to use pause buttons
* Spreadsheets that show time


## Project Overview

TM is a Time Management GUI application, that will help teams track time spent on projects with the purpose of increasing efficiency of a team or a single developer who would like to maximize his/her time to increase profits. TM is a desktop application.

When users open up TM, they are greeted with a log in/create account graphical user interface. After logging in the application will either take them to a dashboard for developers or a dashboard for managers. Each type of user has their own uses from this point.

## Project Architecture

We will be implementing a two-tier client/server architecture for the TM project. with the user interface located in the userâ€™s desktop environment, and all storage needs are met with the use of a remote database.

![Architecture](Images/Diagram.png)

**Client side:** will be implemented with the use of Java8 and a choice of GUI library between Swing or JavaFX.

**Server side:** MySQL for implementing a simple DBMS, which will store the information such as login data and summaries.
