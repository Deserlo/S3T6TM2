# Design Document for TM 

## Introduction

Time Management application TM is created mainly for developers and managers of small teams to help them start tracking time more efficiently to increase productivity and possibly grow the revenue.

## Product Reviews

We have looked into two applications for research purposes: Timely and GetHarvest. Timely app is a simple application that helps track time, profit and efficiency. They also implement an idea of time as budget for each project, which gave us the idea of adding budget to TM.
GetHarvest is a more complex application, that can not only track time, but also estimate how much time a future project may take. Although this is an interesting and useful feature, it is out of the scope of our project.


## Project Overview

TM is a Time Management GUI application, that will help teams track time spent on projects with a purpose of increasing efficiency of a team or of a single developer who would like to maximise his time to increase profits.
